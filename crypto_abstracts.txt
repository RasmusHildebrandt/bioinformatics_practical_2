Cryptosporidium spp. are important enteric pathogens in a wide range of
vertebrates including humans. Previous comparative analysis revealed conservation
in genome composition, gene content, and gene organization among Cryptosporidium 
spp., with a progressive reductive evolution in metabolic pathways and
invasion-related proteins. In this study, we sequenced the genome of zoonotic
pathogen Cryptosporidium felis and conducted a comparative genomic analysis.
While most intestinal Cryptosporidium species have similar genomic
characteristics and almost complete genome synteny, fewer protein-coding genes
and some sequence inversions and translocations were found in the C. felis
genome. The C. felis genome exhibits much higher GC content (39.6 %) than other
Cryptosporidium species (24.3-32.9 %), especially at the third codon position
(GC3) of protein-coding genes. Thus, C. felis has a different codon usage, which 
increases the use of less energy costly amino acids (Gly and Ala) encoded by
GC-rich codons. While the tRNA usage is conserved among Cryptosporidium species, 
consistent with its higher GC content, C. felis uses a unique tRNA for GTG for
valine instead of GTA in other Cryptosporidium species. Both mutational pressures
and natural selection are associated with the evolution of the codon usage in
Cryptosporidium spp., while natural selection seems to drive the codon usage in
C. felis. Other unique features of the C. felis genome include the loss of the
entire traditional and alternative electron transport systems and several
invasion-related proteins. Thus, the preference for the use of some less energy
costly amino acids in C. felis may lead to a more harmonious parasite-host
interaction, and the strengthened host-adaptation is reflected by the further
reductive evolution of metabolism and host invasion-related proteins.

Cryptosporidium is known to be the second most common diarrheal pathogen in
children, causing potentially fatal diarrhea and associated with long-term growth
stunting and cognitive deficits. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved
treatment for cryptosporidiosis is nitazoxanide, but this drug has not shown
potentially effective results in susceptible hosts. Therefore, a safe and
effective drug for cryptosporidiosis is urgently needed. Cryptosporidium genome
sequencing analysis may help develop an effective drug, but both in vitro and in 
vivo approaches to drug evaluation are not fully standardized. On the other hand,
the development of partial immunity after exposure suggests the possibility of a 
successful and effective vaccine, but protective surrogates are not precise. In
this review, we present our current perspectives on novel cryptosporidiosis
therapies, vaccine targets and efficacies, as well as potential mitigation plans,
recommendations and perceived challenges.

The enteric parasite, Cryptosporidium is a major cause of diarrhoeal illness in
humans and animals worldwide. No effective therapeutics or vaccines are available
and therefore control is dependent on understanding transmission dynamics. The
development of molecular detection and typing tools has resulted in the
identification of a large number of cryptic species and genotypes and facilitated
our understanding of their potential for zoonotic transmission. Of the 44
recognised Cryptosporidium species and >120 genotypes, 19 species, and four
genotypes have been reported in humans with C. hominis, C. parvum, C.
meleagridis, C. canis and C. felis being the most prevalent. The development of
typing tools that are still lacking some zoonotic species and genotypes and more 
extensive molecular epidemiological studies in countries where the potential for 
transmission is highest are required to further our understanding of this
important zoonotic pathogen. Similarly, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and
amplicon next-generation sequencing (NGS) are important for more accurately
tracking transmission and understanding the mechanisms behind host specificity.

Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of waterborne diarrheal disease globally and
an important contributor to mortality in infants and the immunosuppressed.
Despite its importance, the Cryptosporidium community has only had access to a
good, but incomplete, Cryptosporidium parvum IOWA reference genome sequence.
Incomplete reference sequences hamper annotation, experimental design, and
interpretation. We have generated a new C. parvum IOWA genome assembly supported 
by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore long-read technologies and a 
new comparative and consistent genome annotation for three closely related
species: C. parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis, and Cryptosporidium tyzzeri We made 
1926 C. parvum annotation updates based on experimental evidence. They include
new transporters, ncRNAs, introns, and altered gene structures. The new assembly 
and annotation revealed a complete Dnmt2 methylase ortholog. Comparative
annotation between C. parvum, C. hominis, and C. tyzzeri revealed that most
"missing" orthologs are found, suggesting that the biological differences between
the species must result from gene copy number variation, differences in gene
regulation, and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). Using the new assembly and
annotation as reference, 190 genes are identified as evolving under positive
selection, including many not detected previously. The new C. parvum IOWA
reference genome assembly is larger, gap free, and lacks ambiguous bases. This
chromosomal assembly recovers all 16 chromosome ends, 13 of which are
contiguously assembled. The three remaining chromosome ends are provisionally
placed. These ends represent duplication of entire chromosome ends including
subtelomeric regions revealing a new level of genome plasticity that will both
inform and impact future research.

Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of waterborne outbreaks globally, and
Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum are the principal cause of human
cryptosporidiosis on the planet. Thanks to the advances in Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS) sequencing and bioinformatic software development, more than 100
genomes have been generated in the last decade using a metagenomic-like strategy.
This procedure involves the parasite oocyst enrichment from stool samples of
infected individuals, NGS sequencing, metagenomic assembly, parasite genome
computational filtering, and comparative genomic analysis. Following this
approach, genomes of infected individuals of all continents have been generated, 
although with striking different quality results. In this study, we performed a
thorough comparison, in terms of assembly quality and purity, of 100+ de novo
assembled genomes of C. hominis. Remarkably, after quality genome filtering, a
comprehensive phylogenomic analysis allowed us to discover that C. hominis
encompasses two lineages with continental segregation. These lineages were named 
based on the observed continental distribution bias as C. hominis Euro-American
(EA) and the C. hominis Afro-Asian (AA) lineages.

The protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia are significant causes of
diarrhoea worldwide and are responsible for numerous waterborne and foodborne
outbreaks of diseases. Over the last 50 years, the development of improved
detection and typing tools has facilitated the expanding range of named species. 
Currently at least 44 Cryptosporidium spp. and >120 genotypes, and nine Giardia
spp., are recognised. Many of these Cryptosporidium genotypes will likely be
described as species in the future. The phylogenetic placement of Cryptosporidium
at the genus level is still unclear and further research is required to better
understand its evolutionary origins. Zoonotic transmission has long been known to
play an important role in the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis,
and the development and application of next generation sequencing tools is
providing evidence for this. Comparative whole genome sequencing is also
providing key information on the genetic mechanisms for host specificity and
human infectivity, and will enable One Health management of these zoonotic
parasites in the future.

Cryptosporidium bovis is a common enteric pathogen in bovine animals. The
research on transmission characteristics of the pathogen is hampered by the lack 
of subtyping tools. In this study, we retrieve the nucleotide sequence of the 60 
kDa glycoprotein (GP60) from the whole genome sequences of C. bovis we obtained
previously and analyze its sequence characteristics. Despite a typical structure 
of the GP60 protein, the GP60 of C. bovis had only 19.3-45.3% sequence identity
to those of other Cryptosporidium species. On the basis of the gene sequence, a
subtype typing tool was developed for C. bovis and used in the analysis of 486 C.
bovis samples from dairy cattle, yaks, beef cattle, and water buffalos from
China. Sixty-eight sequence types were identified from 260 subtyped samples,
forming six subtype families, namely XXVIa to XXVIf. The mosaic sequence patterns
among subtype families and the 121 potential recombination events identified
among the sequences both suggest the occurrence of genetic recombination at the
locus. No obvious host adaptation and geographic differences in the distribution 
of subtype families were observed. Most farms with more extensive sampling had
more than one subtype family, and the dominant subtype families on a farm
appeared to differ between pre- and post-weaned calves, indicating the likely
occurrence of multiple episodes of C. bovis infections. There was an association 
between XXVId infection and occurrence of moderate diarrhea in dairy cattle. The 
subtyping tool developed and the data generated in the study might improve our
knowledge of the genetic diversity and transmission of C. bovis.

BACKGROUND: Stable transfection systems have been described in many protozoan
parasites, including Plasmodium falciparum, Cryptosporidium parvum, Babesia
bovis, Babesia ovata, and Babesia gibsoni. For Babesia sp. Xinjiang (Bxj), which 
is the causative pathogen of ovine babesiosis and mainly prevails across China,
the platform of those techniques remains absent. Genetic manipulation techniques 
are powerful tools to enhance our knowledge on parasite biology, which may
provide potential drug targets and diagnostic markers.
METHODS: We evaluated the inhibition efficiency of blasticidin (BSD) and WR99210 
to Bxj. Then, a plasmid was constructed bearing selectable marker BSD, green
fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, and rhoptry-associated protein-1 3' terminator
region (rap 3' TR). The plasmid was integrated into the elongation factor-1 alpha
(ef-1α) site of Bxj genome by cross-over homologous recombination technique.
Twenty μg of plasmid was transfected into Bxj merozoites. Subsequently, drug
selection was performed 24 h after transfection to generate transfected
parasites.
RESULTS: Transfected parasite lines, Bxj-c1, Bxj-c2, and Bxj-c3, were
successfully obtained after transfection, drug selection, and colonization.
Exogenous genes were integrated into the Bxj genome, which were confirmed by PCR 
amplification and sequencing. In addition, results of western blot (WB) and
indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that GFP-BSD had expressed for
11 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In our present study, stable transfection system for Bxj was
successfully developed. We anticipate that this platform will greatly facilitate 
basic research of Bxj.

Parasites often have complex developmental cycles that account for their presence
in a variety of difficult-to-analyze matrices, including feces, water, soil, and 
food. Detection of parasites in these matrices still involves laborious methods. 
Untargeted sequencing of nucleic acids extracted from those matrices in
metagenomic projects may represent an attractive alternative method for unbiased 
detection of these pathogens. Here, we show how publicly available metagenomic
datasets can be mined to detect parasite specific sequences, and generate data
useful for environmental surveillance. We use the protozoan parasite
Cryptosporidium parvum as a test organism, and show that detection is influenced 
by the reference sequence chosen. Indeed, the use of the whole genome yields high
sensitivity but low specificity, whereas specificity is improved through the use 
of signature sequences. In conclusion, querying metagenomic datasets for
parasites is feasible and relevant, but requires optimization and validation.
Nevertheless, this approach provides access to the large, and rapidly increasing,
number of datasets from metagenomic and meta-transcriptomic studies, allowing
unlocking hitherto idle signals of parasites in our environments.

Cryptosporidium parvum, a predominant causal agent of a fatal zoonotic protozoan 
diarrhoeal disease called cryptosporidiosis, bears a worldwide public health
concern for childhood mortality and poses a key threat to the dairy and water
industries. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small but powerful posttranscriptional gene
silencing RNA molecules, regulate a variety of molecular, biological, and
cellular processes in animals and plants. As to the present date, there is a
paucity of information regarding miRNAs of C. parvum; hence, this study was used 
to identify miRNAs in the organism using a comprehensible expressed sequence
tag-based homology search approach consisting of a series of computational
screening process from the identification of putative miRNA candidates to the
functional annotation of the important gene targets in C. parvum. The results
revealed a conserved miRNA that targeted 487 genes in the model organism
(Drosophila melanogaster) and 85 genes in C. parvum, of which 11 genes had direct
involvements in several crucial virulence factors such as environmental oocyst
protection, excystation, locomotion, adhesion, invasion, stress protection,
intracellular growth, and survival. Besides, 20 genes showed their association
with various major pathways dedicated for the ribosomal biosynthesis, DNA repair,
transportation, protein production, gene expression, cell cycle, cell
proliferation, development, immune response, differentiation, and nutrient
metabolism of the organism in the host. Thus, this study provides a strong
evidence of great impact of identified miRNA on the biology, virulence, and
pathogenesis of C. parvum. Furthermore, the study suggests that the detected
miRNA could be a potential epigenomic tool for controlling the protozoon through 
silencing those virulent and pathway-related target genes.

Cryptosporidiosis is a significant cause of diarrhea in sheep and goats. Among
the over 40 established species of Cryptosporidium, Cryptosporidium xiaoi is one 
of the dominant species infecting ovine and caprine animals. The lack of
subtyping tools makes it impossible to examine the transmission of this pathogen.
In the present study, we identified and characterized the 60-kDa glycoprotein
(gp60) gene by sequencing the genome of C. xiaoi. The GP60 protein of C. xiaoi
had a signal peptide, a furin cleavage site of RSRR, a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and over 100 O-glycosylation sites. Based on
the gp60 sequence, a subtyping tool was developed and used in characterizing C.
xiaoi in 355 positive samples from sheep and goats in China. A high sequence
heterogeneity was observed in the gp60 gene, with 94 sequence types in 12 subtype
families, namely XXIIIa to XXIIIl. Co-infections with multiple subtypes were
common in these animals, suggesting that genetic recombination might be
responsible for the high diversity within C. xiaoi. This was supported by the
mosaic sequence patterns among the subtype families. In addition, a potential
host adaptation was identified within this species, reflected by the exclusive
occurrence of XXIIIa, XXIIIc, XXIIIg, and XXIIIj in goats. This subtyping tool
should be useful in studies of the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of
C. xiaoi.

Cryptosporidiosis is ranked sixth in the list of the most important food-borne
parasites globally, and it is an important contributor to mortality in infants
and the immunosuppressed. Recently, the number of genome sequences available for 
this parasite has increased drastically. The majority of the sequences are
derived from population studies of Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium
hominis, the most important species causing disease in humans. Work with this
parasite is challenging since it lacks an optimal, prolonged, in vitro culture
system, which accurately reproduces the in vivo life cycle. This obstacle makes
the cloning of isolates nearly impossible. Thus, patient isolates that are
sequenced represent a population or, at times, mixed infections. Oocysts, the
lifecycle stage currently used for sequencing, must be considered a population
even if the sequence is derived from single-cell sequencing of a single oocyst
because each oocyst contains four haploid meiotic progeny (sporozoites).
Additionally, the community does not yet have a set of universal markers for
strain typing that are distributed across all chromosomes. These variables pose
challenges for population studies and require careful analyses to avoid biased
interpretation. This review presents an overview of existing population studies,

The advancement in metagenomic techniques has provided novel tools for profiling 
human parasites in environmental matrices, such as water and wastewater. However,
application of metagenomic techniques for the profiling of protozoan parasites in
environmental matrices is not commonly reported in the literature. The key
factors leading to the less common use of metagenomics are the complexity and
large eukaryotic genome, the prevalence of small parasite populations in
environmental samples compared to bacteria, difficulties in extracting DNA from
(oo)cysts, and limited reference databases for parasites. This calls for further 
research to develop optimized methods specifically looking at protozoan parasites
in the environment. This study reviews the current workflow, methods and provide 
recommendations for the standardization of techniques. The article identifies and
summarizes the key methods, advantages, and limitations associated with
metagenomic analysis, like sample pre-processing, DNA extraction, sequencing
approaches, and analysis methods. The study enhances the understanding and
application of standardized protocols for profiling of protozoan parasite
community from highly complexe samples and further creates a resourceful
comparison among datasets without any biases.

Cryptosporidium parvum is a major cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in humans 
and animals. Its compact genome contains 22 genes encoding divergent
insulinase-like proteases (INS), which are poorly characterized. In this study,
two small members of this family, INS-21 encoded by cgd7_2080 and INS-23 encoded 
by cgd5_3400, were cloned, expressed, and characterized to understand their
functions. Recombinant INS-21 and INS-23 were expressed in Escherichia coli and
polyclonal antibodies against these two proteins were prepared. The cgd7_2080
gene had a high transcription level during 0-2 h of in vitro C. parvum culture,
while cgd5_3400 was highly transcribed at 0-6 h. INS-21 was mostly located in the
apical region of sporozoites and merozoites whereas INS-23 was found as spots in 
sporozoites and merozoites. The immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the
expression of INS-21 in the apical region of sporozoites while INS-23 appeared to
be expressed in the dense granules of sporozoites. The neutralization efficiency 
was approximately 35%, when the cultures were treated with anti-INS23 antibodies.
These results suggest that INS-21 and INS-23 are expressed in different
organelles and might have different functions in the development of C. parvum.

Cats are important hosts for different zoonotic parasites that can be hazardous
to human health. To date, few studies have attempted to identify the factors
affecting parasitic infections in shelter animals. This study aims to analyse the
presence of endoparasites in shelter cats in Tartu, Estonia, and identify factors
affecting endoparasite prevalence and intensity. The risk factors considered were
age, location (urban vs rural cats) and time spent in shelter. In total, 290
faecal samples were collected from cats at an animal shelter in 2015-2016 and
investigated for endoparasites using the concentration flotation technique. In
total, 138 shelter cats (47.6%) were infected with endoparasites and their
overall prevalence was: Toxocara cati (36.6%), Cystoisospora spp. (12.4%),
Taeniidae gen. sp. (4.1%), Toxoplasma gondii/Hammondia hammondi (3.4%), Eucoleus 
aerophilus (2.1%), Cryptosporidium spp. (2.1%), Ancylostoma sp. (0.7%) and
Giardia sp. (0.7%). Coinfections occurred in 38 cats (13.1%) most frequently of
T. cati and Cystoisospora spp. (4.5%), Cystoisospora spp. and T. gondii/H.
hammondi (2.1%). Where species identification of cestode and nematode samples was
not possible according to morphology, genetic analysis of the mitochondrial cox1 
gene was carried out. DNA was successfully analysed for 6 out of 13 samples that 
required genetic identification, revealing Ancylostoma tubaeforme in one nematode
sample and Hydatigera taeniaeformis in five cestode samples. Cats from rural
areas had significantly higher endoparasite prevalence than cats from urban
areas. Helminth prevalence decreased to some extent due to anthelmintic treatment
in cats available for adoption (held ≥15 days in the shelter), whereas the
prevalence of infection with protists increased significantly in these animals.
It is important to note that the analysis revealed lower infection intensity for 
quarantine cats (held 1-14 days in the shelter) compared with cats available for 
adoption. The relatively high prevalence of endoparasites (including zoonotic) in
shelter cats ready for adoption suggests that current anthelminthic procedures
require improvements.

Cryptosporidiumparvum is a common protozoan pathogen responsible for
moderate-to-severe diarrhea in humans and animals. The small genome of C. parvum 
has 22 genes encoding insulinlike proteases (INS) with diverse sequences,
suggesting that members of the protein family may have different biological
functions in the life cycle. In this study, two members of the INS family,
CpINS-4 and CpINS-6 with the Zn2+-binding motif "HXXEH" but different numbers of 
function domains, were expressed in Escherichia coli and used in the generation
of polyclonal antibodies. In both recombinant and native proteins, CpINS-4 and
CpINS-6 were spliced into multiple fragments. The antibodies generated recognized
their respective recombinant and native proteins and the spliced products, but
had minimum cross-reactivity with each other. Anti-CpINS-4 antibodies reacted
with the middle region of sporozoites and merozoites, while CpINS-6 had the
highest reactivity to the apical region. Polyclonal anti-CpINS-4 antibodies
produced 36% reduction in parasite load in HCT-8 cultures at 24 h, while those
against CpINS-6, which has one of the function domains missing, failed in doing
so. The genes encoding both CpINS-4 and CpINS-6 had the highest expression in the
invasion phase of in vitro C. parvum culture. These data suggest that CpINS-4 and
CpINS-6 might be expressed in different organelles and play different biological 
functions in the life cycle of C. parvum.

BACKGROUND: genetic susceptibility to infection is mediated by numerous host
factors, including the highly diverse, classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
genes, which are critical genetic determinants of immunity. We systematically
evaluated the effect of HLA alleles and haplotypes on susceptibility to 12 common
enteric infections in children during the first year of life in an urban slum of 
Dhaka, Bangladesh.
METHODS: a birth cohort of 601 Bangladeshi infants was prospectively monitored
for diarrhoeal disease. Each diarrhoeal stool sample was analyzed for enteric
pathogens by multiplex TaqMan Array Card (TAC). High resolution genotyping of HLA
class I (A and B) and II (DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1) genes was performed by
next-generation sequencing. We compared the frequency of HLA alleles and
haplotypes between infected and uninfected children.
FINDINGS: we identified six individual allele associations and one five-locus
haplotype association. One allele was associated with protection: A*24:02 - EAEC.
Five alleles were associated with increased risk: A*24:17 - typical EPEC, B*15:01
- astrovirus, B*38:02 - astrovirus, B*38:02 - Cryptosporidium and DQA1*01:01 -
Cryptosporidium. A single five-locus haplotype was associated with protection:
A*11:01~B*15:02~DRB1*12:02~DQA1*06:01~DQB1*03:01- adenovirus 40/41.
INTERPRETATION: our findings suggest a role for HLA in susceptibility to early
enteric infection for five pathogens. Understanding the genetic contribution of
HLA in susceptibility has important implications in vaccine design and
understanding regional differences in incidence of enteric infection.

BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium parvum is an enteric protozoan parasite with zoonotic
importance and can cause cryptosporidiosis in humans as well as domestic and wild
animals worldwide. The IId subtype family (SF) is one of the most prevalent
subtypes of C. parvum. Some clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein systems have been developed 
to detect nucleic acid with high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity.
METHODS: By integrating recombinase polymerase amplification and the Cas12a/crRNA
trans-cleavage system (termed ReCTC), we established end-point diagnostics by
observing fluorescence readouts with the naked eye under blue light and on-site
diagnostics using a lateral flow strip (LFS) biosensor.
RESULTS: Our ReCTC-based diagnoses can detect as little as a single copy of a
cloned C. parvum 60-kDa glycoprotein (GP60) gene, 10 oocysts per gram (OPG),
clinical fecal sample without tedious extraction of genomic DNA and have no
cross-reactivity with other SFs of C. parvum or other common enteric parasitic
protozoa.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a new strategy for direct identification of the 
IId SF of C. parvum free of highly trained operators and expensive special
equipment.

BACKGROUND: Apicomplexa is a diverse phylum comprising unicellular endobiotic
animal parasites and contains some of the most well-studied microbial eukaryotes 
including the devastating human pathogens Plasmodium falciparum and
Cryptosporidium hominis. In contrast, data on the invertebrate-infecting
gregarines remains sparse and their evolutionary relationship to other
apicomplexans remains obscure. Most apicomplexans retain a highly modified
plastid, while their mitochondria remain metabolically conserved. Cryptosporidium
spp. inhabit an anaerobic host-gut environment and represent the known exception,
having completely lost their plastid while retaining an extremely reduced
mitochondrion that has lost its genome. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing
have enabled the first broad genome-scale explorations of gregarines, providing
evidence of differential plastid retention throughout the group. However, little 
is known about the retention and metabolic capacity of gregarine mitochondria.
RESULTS: Here, we sequenced transcriptomes from five species of gregarines
isolated from cockroaches. We combined these data with those from other
apicomplexans, performed detailed phylogenomic analyses, and characterized their 
mitochondrial metabolism. Our results support the placement of Cryptosporidium as
the earliest diverging lineage of apicomplexans, which impacts our interpretation
of evolutionary events within the phylum. By mapping in silico predictions of
core mitochondrial pathways onto our phylogeny, we identified convergently
reduced mitochondria. These data show that the electron transport chain has been 
independently lost three times across the phylum, twice within gregarines.
CONCLUSIONS: Apicomplexan lineages show variable functional restructuring of
mitochondrial metabolism that appears to have been driven by adaptations to
parasitism and anaerobiosis. Our findings indicate that apicomplexans are rife
with convergent adaptations, with shared features including morphology, energy
metabolism, and intracellularity.
